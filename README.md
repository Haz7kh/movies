The Movie Review App is a backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, using Mongoose for database interactions. It supports user registration and login, with JWT-based authentication. Users are assigned roles (user or admin), where admins manage movies and users add reviews. Key features include adding, updating, deleting, and fetching movies and reviews. Admins have exclusive rights to manage movies, while all users can add and manage their own reviews. The app follows secure and efficient practices to ensure reliable access control and data management. Ideal for managing movie reviews with robust role-based permissions.
